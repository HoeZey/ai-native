# Wayfinder

Multi-session planning. Name the destination, chart the questions that block the way, settle them one at a time. **Plan, don't do.**

Session count, not project size: if one `grill-me` sitting can settle it, skip this skill.

## Hard rules

1. **One destination = one map.** When the tracker is Jira, that destination is one epic. Not "V1". A sprawling destination goes stale.
2. **Decision tickets are questions**, never "build the X". If a ticket reads as a sprint story, it belongs in `to-issues` after the map clears.
3. **Do not mix issue types.** The map is the parent. Children are decision tickets, not implementation stories. When Jira is configured, use the project's non-story type for children. Never dump the map into a sprint.
4. **One ticket per session** (research may run in parallel). Charting does not resolve tickets.
5. **No production code.** `task` unblocks a decision (access, sample data). It is not a slice of the build.
6. **No tracker writes until the quiz is approved.** Draft markdown first. Publish only where the project tracks work, and only if the user agrees.
7. When the map is clear, **hand off to `write-a-prd`**. Do not skip the spec. Do not call `to-issues` on the map itself. Do not call `tdd`.

## Ticket types

Every child is HITL (needs the user) or AFK (agent alone).

| Type | Mode | When | Resolve with |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grilling` | HITL | Default. Talking can settle it. | `grill-me` or `grill-me-with-docs` |
| `research` | AFK | A fact outside the repo blocks a decision. | `research` |
| `prototype` | HITL | Ungrillable: how it should look / feel / behave. | `prototype` |
| `task` | either | Manual unblock only (credentials, fixture data). | Checklist or agent; **not** product code |

## Map body

```markdown
# Map: <destination>

## Destination
<one or two lines — what "done planning" looks like, usually a spec colleagues can review>

## Notes
<domain; skills every session should consult; standing preferences>

## Decisions so far
- [<closed ticket title>](link): <one-line gist>

## Not yet specified
<fog — questions you can tell are coming but cannot phrase sharply yet>

## Out of scope
<ruled out of this destination; never graduates>
```

The map is an **index**, not a store. The answer lives on the ticket. The map gists and links.

## Decision ticket body

```markdown
## Question
<the decision this ticket resolves — one session>

## Type
grilling | research | prototype | task

## Blocked by
<none | other decision titles>

## Answer
*(empty until resolved)*
```

**Fog vs ticket:** ticket when the question is already sharp (even if blocked). Fog when you cannot phrase it yet. Do not pre-slice fog into fake tickets.

## Modes

### Chart the map (once)

1. Grill the **destination** first (`grill-me-with-docs` if `CONTEXT.md` exists). Scope is the destination.
2. Breadth-first grill: fan out across the space. If this surfaces **no fog** and the whole path fits one session, stop — you don't need a map.
3. Draft the map + only the tickets you can specify now. Leave the rest in **Not yet specified**.
4. Quiz: destination, ticket list (title / type / blocked-by), fog vs out-of-scope. Iterate until approved.
5. Publish only after the quiz, and only where the project tracks work. Markdown: write the map under `{root}/planning/maps/<slug>.md` (`root` from `context/INDEX.md`, else `docs/INDEX.md`) and link decision tickets from it. Do not require Jira. Jira: when `tracker.kind` is `jira` and the user agrees, the epic is the map and children link to that epic, using the project's issue types. If the tracker has no hierarchy capability, keep the map in markdown and say so. Research tickets may start in the background after publish.
6. Stop. Do not resolve a grilling ticket in the charting session.

### Work through the map

1. Load the map at low resolution (not every ticket body).
2. Take the first **frontier** ticket (open, unblocked, unclaimed), or the one the user named. Claim it (assignee) before work.
3. Resolve with the matching skill. One question per grill turn (see `grill-me`).
4. Record the answer on the ticket, close it, append one gist line to **Decisions so far**.
5. Graduate fog that is now a sharp question into new tickets (quiz, then publish). If a ticket sits past the destination, close it into **Out of scope**.
6. Stop. Next session takes the next frontier ticket.

When no tickets remain and fog is empty: tell the user the map is clear and the next skill is `write-a-prd`.

## Failure modes

- Agent writes product code because a `task` looked like a build slice → stop, retitle as a question or move it to `to-issues` later.
- Agent answers its own grilling questions → HITL is broken; wait for the user.
- Destination is "the whole product" → shrink to one destination before charting.
